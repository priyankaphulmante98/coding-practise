// 👉 Difference between let, const, and var?                    
                                                                              
// # var 
// The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
// It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
// It can be declared without initialization.	
// It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.	
// hoisting done, with initializing as ‘default’ value	
//ex =>
//  var a= 20;
//  console.log(a)
//  var a=20;

// #let
// The scope of a let variable is block scope.
// It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.
// It can be declared without initialization.
// It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.
// Hoisting is done , but not initialized (this is the reason for the error when we access the let variable before declaration/initialization	

// #const
// The scope of a const variable is block scope.
// It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
// It cannot be declared without initialization.
// It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.
//  Hoisting is done, but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the const variable before declaration/initialization


// 👉 What are the new ES6 features you have used?
// Default Parameters 
// Template Literals 
// Multi-line Strings
// Destructuring Assignment 
// Enhanced Object Literals 
// Arrow Functions 
// Promises 
// Block-Scoped Constructs Let and Const.
// modules
// classes


// 👉 What is the strict mode in javascript?
// 'use strict';
// //Strict mode makes some bad practices return errors.
// //Some programmers use this to help them avoid bad habits.

// //ex ==>
// 'use strict';

// function myfunction() {
  
//  var v = "This is a strict mode function";
//     console.log(v)
// }
// myfunction();

// 👉 What is the Box model in CSS?

//In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

// The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

// Explanation of the different parts:

// Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
// Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
// Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
// Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

//ex ==>
// div {
//   width: 300px;
//   border: 5px solid green;
//   padding: 50px;
//   margin: 20px;
// }

// 👉 Difference between Position Absolute and Relative?

// position: relative
//  places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it

//  position: absolute 
// places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.


// 👉 What are semantic elements?

// Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements 
//  <header> , <nav> , <section> , <aside> ,<footer> and <article> 
    
// are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.
