        "author": "J. K. Rowling",
    		"genre": "fiction",

    		"publisher": "Bloomsbury",
    		"cost": 1299,
    		"borrowed": false,
      }
    ]
    ```
    

- Use a JSON server to manage the data (using local storage or dummy data will lead to disqualification)Rubrics / Criteria to be judged upon

    - Author of the book

- Maintain flow of app as mentioned.
- Error messages should be shown
- Use loaders.
- Good designs will fetch bonus marks.
- Submitting local host links for mock server will lead to disqualification.

### Submission

- Please submit deployed link and Github link of code.
- ***Deploy JSON server too. (submitting [localhost](http://localhost) link will lead to disqualification)
- Please double check if deployed version works or not (run deployed version on your laptop and then submit it)
- **Push your code into `masai-repo`, donâ€™t submit personal repo links (submitting personal repo links will lead to disqualification)**
- Any issues in deployed link will be considered null and void.
- Please verify your submissions.

- JSON server deployment.
- Fetch
- Promises
- Sorting and Filtering.
- Good UI
- Code cleanliness, folder structure and git hygeine will be looked into.
- Usage of Javascript (using react will lead to disqualification)
